// This module defines common verbs and types of objects for both 
// graphql API and REST API. APIs use these actions and types to 
// describe themselves. Such as an API is about `read` `resource`s, or
// an API is about `manage` a `channel`, etc. 

// We avoid to define specific RBAC roles required for APIs here.
// This is because providers would have more flexibility to decide 
// which role is required for a given API call.

// Each Authorization provider translates these actions and types to 
// its own RBAC API calls to validate users permission on a given API.
 
// The default Auth provider rbac.js just logs the action and type of 
// the object and validate user api key without actually invoke any
// backend RBAC API. It totally depends on each Authorization providers 
// to define their own RBAC policies and logic.
